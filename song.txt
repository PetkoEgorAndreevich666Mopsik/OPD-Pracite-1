Cola - Lana Del Rey

My pussy tastes like Pepsi-Cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I got a taste for men who’re older
It’s always been, so it’s no surprise

Harvey’s in the sky with diamonds
And it’s making me crazy
All he wants to do is party
With his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let’s ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife, and she wouldn’t mind
We made it out to the other side

Harvey’s in the sky with diamonds
And it’s making me crazy
All he wants to do is party
With his pretty baby

We’re alive
All we wanna do is party
Party all the time
Party all the time
Party all the time

Harvey’s in the sky with diamonds
And it’s making me crazy
All he wants to do is party
With his pretty baby
